# WPXpress - In Progress

This is an application prototype which is meant to accompany www.wpxpress.co<br><br>
WPXpress is is personal project of mine, which was created to offer an affordable website design service to small business owners on a small budget. The concept is to quickly develop WordPress websites based on pre-existing templates from the Genesis framework. The above landing page was built in one week to test the market response.

## The Concept
The prototype is an interesting concept which could be useful for web design firms.  This app has three purposes:<br>
1) To function as a client portal which tracks the progress of projects<br>
2) To allow clients to "order" a simple website design through a wizard-like interface<br>
3) To reduce client-designer interaction through the initial phase of the design process for efficiency<br>
